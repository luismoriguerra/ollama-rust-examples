n exist in multiple states simultaneously. This property, known as superposition, along with quantum entanglement, allows quantum computers to perform complex calculations at speeds unattainable by traditional computers. This technology holds the potential to revolutionize various fields, including cryptography, drug discovery, and complex system modeling, though it is still in its nascent stages with significant challenges to overcome.
